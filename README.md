## General Information
- Multiple Linear Regression using RFE
- Multiple linear regression is performed on the dataset.The project is done as part of coursework in the Machine Learning module.We are trying to find the number of  rentals issued from the company based on numerous independent values such as temperature, weather, humidity, holiday, etc.The Boombikes bike rental dataset is being  used.
- We are trying to predict the demand of shared bikes
- We have used Boom Bikes dataset



## Conclusions
- The R-squared value of the train set is 83.7% whereas the test set has a value of 80.5% which suggests that our model broadly explains the variance quite 		  accurately on the test set and thus we can conclude that it is a good model.
- Our developed model's mean squared error is almost 0 on both the training and testing datasets, so we can say that error values are normally distributed.
- We have used concepts of EDA, p-value, VIF, RFE 





## Technologies Used
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- statsmodels
- sci-kit learn
- numpy
